# MSci 2021 - Quantitative Provenance: Chemical Fluxes across landscapes

Project working on quantifying and modelling geochemistry across river systems.  

- **Forward problem:** Using chemistry in geochemical maps to predict downstream river sediment chemistry
- **Inverse problem:** Using chemistry from river sediment samples to predict first-order geochemical maps

## Methods

### Preprocessing

#### DEM

- Using SRTMS 1 arcsecon DEM (source: https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/usgs-eros-archive-digital-elevation-shuttle-radar-topography-mission-srtm-1-arc?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects)
- Downsampled to 100x100m grid (gmt grdsample)
- Projected to cylindrical equal area projection (gmt grdproject)
- Sink filling to allow correct flow-routing

#### Data and Flow

#### Setting up topography and localities

- Given "Compiled\_Clyde\_Surface" data unique sample numbers
	+ 1000 to 1010
- Filter surface data to not include estuary samples
	+ Only taking samples with lon > -4.42 (from map)
	+ Using "preprocess\_topo\_loc" script
- Localities are snapped to flow model grid in python
	+ manually checked and some nudged to fit correctly

#### Flow routing and Drainage Areas

- D8 flow routing algorithm to estimate streams
	+ Need to tweak min catchment area for ideal settings
- Snap sample data to nearest stream
	+ Need to manually check each data point to see whether correct snapping happened
	+ Use matplotlib widgets in notebook and gmt maps to correlate
	
#### Geochemical data:

- Combined Upper Clyde River Sediment Survey and Estuarine Geochemical (surface) data sets in one sheet
- Convert all oxides to real element concentrations
	- Constants https://www.jcu.edu.au/advanced-analytical-centre/resources/element-to-stoichiometric-oxide-conversion-factors
- Following locations needed nudging to snap:
	+ 700012: fit on main channel

#### G-BASE input

- Data from:G-BASE geochemical survey 
- filter through to remove bad data and pick correct sampling method for each locality using script by Alex
- Interpolate using `interpolate_gbase.gmt` script
	+ save unprojected and projected version to plot and use
- changing dampening factor 
	
### Model

- Base code for inverse from Lipp et al. 2021
	+ Modified to work for new data set and region
	+ Run on HPC to find ideal lambda for each element
- Forward model using landlab find\_drainage\_area\_and\_discharge
	+ Needs interpolated G-BASE data for region
	+ interpolation using gmt surface to 100x100m grid
	
### Forward Model Workflow

1. Interpolate G-BASE data for element of choice using `interpolate_GBASE.gmt`, move grids to `DATA/INTERPOLATED_GBASE`; MUST CHANGE OUTPUT FILENAME AND $ IN AWK STATEMENT!

2. Change element name in `forward_model.py` and run, output is saved to `DATA/FORWARDMODEL_RESULTS/`
3. Get R2 and RMS misfit stats from `forward_stats.py`, output is saved to `DATA/FORWARDMODEL_RESULTS/` 
4. Plot full results output with `diagnostics_dashboard.gmt` need to change $ in AWK STATEMENTS! ADD COEFFICIENT

## Results

### Forward Model

- In Mg, see most misfit in Glasgow area, draining NE of Glasgow
	+ dataset differences?
	+ lack of G-BASE data in Glasgow? misfits line up with river segment only fed by glasgow city area
- River profile for Mg very uniform

## Literature

### Cation Exchange

- Sediment-seawater cation exchange in Himalaya, Lupker et al 2016: https://esurf.copernicus.org/articles/4/675/2016/esurf-4-675-2016.pdf
	+ Measured cation exchange rates in Ganga and Brahmaputra basins
	+ Using cation exchange capacity (CEC), number of cations bound to mineral surface charges that can be reversibly exchanged
	+ CEC strongly variable in water column -> sediment sorting with depth
	+ CEC of all cations very close to Ca^2+ and Mg^2+ values
	+ dissolved Ca^2+ in ocean higher due to exchanges with Na^+ (6% flux), Mg^2+ & K^+ (5% flux)
	+ readsorbtion of Na^+ , Mg^2+ and K^+ also existent
	+ cation exchange does not signficantly impact effect of silicate weathering on carbon sequestration
	+ coarse, low surface area lead to overall low CEC

## Meeting Notes

### 8th October - Roberts

- get forward model to run first
	+ for Magnesium first
	+ recreate Alex's figures about it
	+ get code from github and 
	+ try some other elements as well

### 10th October - Lipp

- need to write Powell with iteratively printing
	+ test first with 10x10
- use find\_drainage\_area\_and\_discharge to run forward model
 

### 12th October - Lipp

- extract data misfit from minimum working example (prediction <-> observations)
- check versus G-BASE data
- port model to .py scripts
	+ generic loading in
	+ for loop through different lambda
- get G-BASE interpolation
- Try Chromium
- for HPC
	+ be on Imperial VPN
	+ username needs clearing
	+ uses pbs for jobs

### 18th October - Roberts & Lipp

- Overall forward model results promising
- interpolated G-BASE data looks spotty
	+ Try smoother interpolation by decreasing tension factor in grd surface
	+ check G-BASE points plotted to see expected interpolation
- tighter colourscale could help show variability better
	+ homogeneity can be from lack of changes too
- RMS should be around 0.1 if model predicts well
	+ R^2 of less use as more variabilty is to be expected
- In cross plots, plot CUSP and surface data separately
- [ ] Create script for big diagnostics plot -> can be generated for each element; make two scripts? (GMT 1-3; Python 4-6)
	1. 	raw distribution
	2. 	interpolated G-BASE data
	3. 	results with observations above
	4. 	cross plot; showing rms and misfit histogram
	5. 	map of misfits
	6. 	river profile
- Should get Glasgow G-BASE data soon
	+ not pristine (used from sludge)
	+ most likely polluted
- Could use geology to find natural baseline
	+ average concentrations from underlying lithology before interpolation 
- [ ] Overlying geologic boundaries on interpolation to see larger structures
- Next meeting: Thursday for next week plan
- gmt tip, run basemap last to avoid artefacts on sides (need to check if this works in modern version)

### 19th October - Lipp

- Run on HPC
	+ add array_index
		* use counter to have each node run just one inversion
	+ create job scripts
		* starting at 2gb memory
		* use 2 CPU to avoid crashed
	+ also output model roughness and data misfit for each lambda
- Setup HPC
	+ using anaconda to install landlab
	+ regular 
- Submit jobs with `qsub`
	+ check jobs with `qstat`
	+ array jobs show up wiht [] after ID
	+ remove faulty jobs with `qdel`
- Try higher resolutions
	+ keep squares
	+ feel free to go high with res
	+ try ~60x50 first (keep square)
- Get landlab working in anaconda
	+ set up anaconda (help in presentation)
- using gmt classic more helpful for dashboards
	+ sent a snippet to get started
	+  -O (overwrite) -K (don't finalize) flags important
	
### 26th October - Lipp

- Suspect NaN result bug comes from `data_misfit` function
- Once inverse runs on HPC should focus on getting diagnostics for forward up
- Low variability in Mg likely due to mainly sedimentary rocks in region
	+ Can try forward model on elements with highest variability in observations next
- Given me the scripts to create synthetic data for inverse, should use eggbox first

## Weekly Plan/Progress

- Fitting localities to drainage network
- Intro sessions/Welcome Fair

### 11th - 17th October:

- Finishing setting up inverse code in jupyter notebook
	+ Getting small example (Mg, 10x10 grid, lambda = 2) to run
- Writing forward model code from inverse
	+ preprocessing same
	+ running forward model with `landlab find_drainage_area_and_discharge()`
	+ plotting results, misfit by locality and cross plot
- Start converting inverse code from jupyter notebook to script
	+ Write to have variable lambda
	+ Parallelisable for use on HPC
	+ Output each raster as `.asc` file

### 18th - 24th October:

- Finished inverse script for HPC
- Start on diagnostics plotting scripts
- Ran first inverse (Mg) suite on HPC
	+ Bug with final misfit, needs fixing
		* Found workaround on local version, needs testing on HPC version before more runs
	+ Found bug with how results got saved
		* Fixed by adding result to ``RasterModelGrid` first, then saving output as `.asc`
- Create plot for inverse results

### 25th - 31st October:

- Fixed inverse model for HPC
	+ bug was how initial NaN values were handled, using `np.nansum` and `np.nanmean` now in `initiate_inverse_smart`
- Running inverse on HPC for elements Mg, Co, Cr, K, Pb, Sr
	+ using lambda exponent values of -2 to 2
- Finishing diagnostics dashboard for forward model
- Need to figure out way to distinguish data sets in plots
	+ Main issue is they're handled the same in python and come as same output
	+ Save in separate files from get go? --> easy for misfit data
		* possible for profile?
		* Could go by distance in profile?
	+ Or doable in gmt? --> avoids cluttering up result files
- Run forward model for Pb, Sn, Sb, Zr
	+ no G-BASE data for Br, Hf --> cannot run forward
	+ need to rerun Sb as interpolation included negative concentrations
